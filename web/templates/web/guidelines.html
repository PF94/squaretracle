			<p>
				Here at Tracle, we enforce our guidelines. We review flagged videos as quickly as we can, so we can take down the video accordingly. The offending account will be disciplined for breaking the Community guidelines and serious or violations which are repeated can end up with the account being terminated from Tracle. Do not try to find loopholes or lawyer your way around the simple rules.
