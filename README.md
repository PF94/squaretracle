Feel free to fork and make a pull request for small changes. If you're planning to change more than a couple of lines 
it's probably better to open an issue first.

### Installation (for development)

squareTracle requires Python3, pip3, Redis with Linux. Windows is not officially supported unless if using WSL.

On Debian-based distros, you can use this command to make sure all needed packages are installed:
```
sudo apt install git python3-venv python3-dev build-essential redis-server
```

If using WSL, The Redis server will need to be manually started.
```
sudo service redis-server start
```

Open a terminal and clone the repository, and then change your working directory to the root of the repository, e.g.

```
git clone https://github.com/TeamTracle/tracle.git
cd tracle
```
Next, create a virtual environment and activate it. I recommend 
using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). e.g.

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

We use pip-tools to manage ``requirements.txt``, so install that, too:
```
pip3 install pip-tools
```

Next, install the dependencies from ``requirements.txt`` and ``requirements_dev.txt``:
```
pip3 install wheel
pip-sync requirements.txt requirements_dev.txt
```

Create a file called ```.env``` with the following content:

```
export DEBUG=1
export BUNNYCDN_ENABLED=0
export INSTALLED_APPS="debug_toolbar" # optional
```

Please note that the site's uploading features may not work without BunnyCDN.

Setup the database:

```
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py loaddata backend/fixtures/categories.json
```

You can then run a local development server using the following command:

```
./manage.py runserver
```

Autoprefixer is run only on deployment or when DEBUG is set to false. You'll need npm to install these node modules:

```
npm install -g postcss-cli autoprefixer
```
